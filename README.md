# atabb-CV-public
This repository provides an example CV in one .tex file, without the use of a class, in latex, suitable for ECE or CS researchers.  The repo is a companion to [this post](https://amytabb.com/ts/2018_11_01/).

*August 4, 2019* 

I created this repository back in late 2018, but less than a year later my CV has changed a lot and I added some new things.  I've added my current document `TabbCV_Jul2019_public`, but also kept the original one.  Note that how to order your CV, and what to put on it, seems to have no standard.  I've seen ones with the reverse order of mine (excepting education, which for academics, seems to always be first)!

There's more commentary about this on my website:
- [general post](https://amytabb.com/ts/2018_11_01/)
- [getting started, for graduate students](https://amytabb.com/ts/2019_02_02/)
- [personal information on CVs and EEO in the USA](https://amytabb.com/ts/2019_02_20/)
